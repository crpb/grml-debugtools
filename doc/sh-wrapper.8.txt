NAME
----
sh-wrapper - wrapper for /bin/sh which logs information about caller to syslog


SYNOPSIS
--------
*sh-wrapper*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*sh-wrapper* is a wrapper for /bin/sh. The link /bin/sh is replaced by sh-wrapper and therefore sh-wrapper can give various information about scripts being executed.

Use it when it's difficult to strace a faulty program. sh-wrapper should show what's going on there.

This programm is deprecated by *event-viewer(8)* but nevertheless quite useful in different situations.

sh-wrapper is hardcoded for /bin/zsh as the system shell. This may change in future relases.
