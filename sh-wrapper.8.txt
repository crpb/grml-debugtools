SYNOPSIS

*sh-wrapper*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*sh-wrapper* is a wrapper for /bin/sh. The link /bin/sh is replaced by sh-wrapper and thus sh-wrapper could give various informations about scripts beeing executed.

It's for such situation where it's difficult to bring an strace near the faulty program. sh-wrapper should just show whats going on there.

This programm is deprecated by *event-viewer(8)* but nevertheless quite usefull in different situations.

sh-wrapper is hardcoded for /bin/zsh as the system shell. This may change in future relases.
